# TRIP TROVE — Travel Community Platform

**TRIP TROVE** is a community-centric travel web application designed to empower travelers, vloggers, and users to share experiences, connect, and monetize their travel content. The platform enables content creators and users to interact, post, share travel journeys, and earn through their posts.



## Overview

TRIP TROVE is aimed at building a social/travel network where users and vloggers can post travel stories, photos, itineraries, reviews, and engage with a community. Through their contributions, users can monetize content (e.g. via ads, paid posts, sponsorships). The idea is to combine social sharing + travel content + earning potential in one full-stack web app.

## Technology Stack

From the repository’s description, some technologies are known (or likely):  
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend / Platform / Data services**: Supabase (for authentication, database, API)  
- **Deployment / Hosting**: Vercel / Netlify / or any platform supporting serverless or full-stack  
- **Database**: Supabase’s built-in Postgres + real-time features  
- **APIs / Serverless functions** for business logic  

You should confirm libraries (e.g. Supabase client, auth, storage), routing, state management, etc.

## Architecture & Flow

1. **User / Client**  
   - Frontend app built with Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind.  
   - Interface for browsing posts, writing posts, profile management, interacting (likes/comments).  
   - Uses API calls to backend / Supabase.

2. **Backend / Supabase**  
   - Supabase handles user authentication, database (tables for users, posts, likes, comments, media), storage (for images/videos), and serverless functions (if needed).  
   - Business logic routes (e.g. checking monetization rules, fetching posts, filters).

3. **Monetization / Payment**  
   - If integrated, payment gateway or logic to distribute earnings.  
   - Logic to record and pay content authors.

4. **Media / Storage**  
   - Uploading images/videos to Supabase Storage or a similar service.  
   - Serving media assets to frontend.

Flow example:  
User → Login / Sign up → Create Post (with media & metadata) → Save to DB and Storage → Post becomes visible → Other users interact (likes/comments) → Metrics recorded → Monetization logic awards earnings to poster.


Description of key folders:  
- `src/`: frontend React or framework code  
- `lib/`: e.g. Supabase client initialization, helper utilities  
- `hooks/`: custom React hooks (for auth, data fetching)  
- `pages/`: route files (if using Next-like or Vite router)  
- `supabase/`: database schema, migrations, SQL scripts

## Installation & Setup

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
   - yarn or npm  
   - Supabase account (free tier is fine)  

2. **Clone repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaonkarkavitaa/TRIP-TROVE-Travel-community-centric-web.git
   cd TRIP-TROVE-Travel-community-centric-web
3. Install dependencies

npm install
# or
yarn

4. Environment variables
Copy .env.example to .env and fill in variables. Common entries:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_public_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

5. Set up database / Supabase

In Supabase dashboard, create tables (users, posts, likes, comments, etc).

If migration SQL scripts are provided (in supabase/ folder), run them.

Configure storage buckets for media uploads.

Security & Authentication

Supabase Auth handles user sign-up / login / session management

Use JWT / tokens stored securely (e.g. HttpOnly cookies or securely in client)

Protect API endpoints and rules via Supabase row-level policies (RLS)

Validate file uploads (size, type)

Sanitize inputs to prevent injection / XSS

Rate-limit or moderate content posting if needed

Monetization / Payment Logic

If you allow users to earn via posts, you likely have a logic that tracks engagement (views, likes) → converts to earnings

Possibly integrate payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal)

Have payout system or wallet for users

Record transactions in DB to keep trace

Limitations & Assumptions

Monetization logic might be simplistic or not production-grade

Depends heavily on Supabase (vendor lock-in)

No offline / mobile app support (unless built)

Moderation / spam control may be minimal

Scalability issues for media-heavy content

No advanced analytics or recommendation engine (unless added)

Future Enhancements

Recommendation engine to suggest posts/users

Real-time notifications (new comment, likes)

Direct messaging between users

Better monetization — subscription, tipping, affiliate links

Mobile app or PWA support

Analytics dashboard for creators

Pagination, caching, server-side rendering for performance

Advanced moderation / content filtering
